        <h1>Favorite TV Shows</h1>
        <p>I really don't care for many modern TV shows, to tell you the truth... except Family Guy and Last Man Standing. No... my favorite shows are from the 70s and 80s! Maybe that's why I like Family Guy so much... they refer to old shows often.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>WKRP In Cincinatti</h3>
        <p>I love DJs Dr Johnny Fever and Venus Flytrap... but most of all, I love that arrogant sales executive Herb Tarlek best. I want a suit like that!</p>
        <div class="pictureRows">
            <!--Embedded frame containing the "WKRP Cincinatti" intro from youtube-->

        </div>


        <br>
        <h3>The Muppet Show</h3>
        <p>Grew up with this! Glad that Disney Plus is finally showing the old episodes... but I am not happy that the "Lullaby of Birdland" number was cut from the Don Knotts episode. That was one of the most pivotal moments of the second season!</p>
        <div class="pictureRows">

        <br>
        <h3>Three's Company</h3>
        <p>Speaking of Don Knotts... how can you not love him as Mr Furley, or R.F. as he preferred? And of course... Jack.</p>
        <div class="pictureRows">

        <h3>Married... With Children</h3>
        <p>Al Bundy may be a rude, abusive, neglectful, dumb ape... but he gave us one of the most inspirational quotes ever heard.</p>
        <!--frame with Bundy's picture on one side, and his inspiration quote on the other-->

Just because I have a stinking job that I hate, a family that doesn't respect me, a whole city that curses the day I was born? Well, that may mean loser to you, but let me tell you something. Every morning when I wake up, I know it's not going to get any better until I go back to sleep again. So I get up, have my watered-down Tang and still-frozen Pop Tart, get in my car with no upholstery, no gas, and six more payments to fight traffic just for the privilege of putting cheap shoes on the cloven hooves of people like you. I'll never play football like I thought I would. I'll never know the touch of a beautiful woman. And I'll never again know the joy of driving without a bag on my head. But I'm not a loser. 'Cause, despite it all, me and every other guy who'll never be what he wanted to be are still out there being what we don't want to be forty hours a week for life. And the fact that I haven't put a gun in my mouth, you pudding of a woman, makes me a WINNER!"</blockquote></td>

        <h3>The Super Dave Osborne Show</h3>
        <p>Super Dave Osborne! The stuntman with the motivation to perform a... less than successful stunt every show, as well as playing host to great performers!</p>

        <p>I loved this show so much... that I created my own Wikipedia page, "List of Super Dave Osborne Show episodes". This guide includes the Super One's musical and comedy guests, how he gets hurt at the end of every show, and his response to his announcer saying "Super Dave! Super Dave! Are you all right?"<br>
        <br>A small smattering of this guide is included below. For the full guide, visit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Dave_episodes">Wikipedia: List of Super Dave Osborne Show Episodes!</a></p>

Fuji helps Super Dave perform the "Ultimate Slam Dunk" using a hydraulic catapult that will raise him upright and shoot him into the air where he will catch the ball and slam dunk it.
